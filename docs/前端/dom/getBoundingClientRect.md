# getBoundingClientRect

The Element.getBoundingClientRect() method returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.

The element's size is equal to its width/height + padding + border-width in the case that the standard box model is being used, or width/height only if box-sizing: border-box has been set on it.
