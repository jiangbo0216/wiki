# [网站的“信任此计算机”选项的安全性如何？](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/26743/how-safe-is-trust-this-computer-option-for-websites)



许多网站都有“信任此计算机”选项，该选项可以绕过某些安全措施（例如：启用了Google的两步验证功能，如果以前将计算机/浏览器标记为受信任的站点，[则](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2544838)无需输入电话代码） 。我很难找到有关该主题的更多信息，尤其是在可能的情况下，尤其是如何安全地实现它。

（*注意：*我专门指的是通用站点，这些站点除了浏览器的功能外没有什么特别的依赖。例如，我的银行站点使用其自己的安全模块（使用Java或ActiveX），但这不在此问题的范围内。 ）

## 假设：

- 实际上，被标记为受信任的计算机实际上仅由受信任的人使用，并且已采取合理的措施来保持其不受恶意软件感染。
- SSL用于与站点进行通信。

## 问题：

1. 根据我的理解，cookie用于存储浏览器和站点之间的任意共享秘密。这就是全部？还是采用某种独特的（不可伪造的）方式来唯一标识该特定计算机或设备？

   - 如果它真的是任意的，它需要什么属性才能抗碰撞和/或伪造？（长度，随机性，...）

2. “可信任”状态是否应该在某个时候到期？或者，如果用户认为计算机/设备受到损害，是否足以提供按需撤消的手段？

3. 它实际上增加了任何安全性吗？再次使用Google示例，我注意到它会定期要求我再次进行身份验证（尽管仅使用用户名/密码）。这背后的原因是什么？

   - 如果它假设计算机仍然受信任，那么就不能让我永远获得认证吗？
   - 如果OTOH假定有恶意用户正在使用它，那么它不应该请求完整的身份验证吗？（即为什么仅假设密码就足够？它是否将计算机本身视为第二大因素？）

   我了解，通常来说，便利性提高了，安全性也降低了。我的疑问是此选项是否违反了两因素身份验证的目的，或者确实是一个合理的折衷方案。

是的，只要您信任可能访问您计算机的其他所有人，并且正确实现了“记住我” /“信任此计算机”选项，就可以安全使用。

通常使用持久性cookie来实现。Cookie包含一个随机的，不可猜测的令牌，可以安全地识别您的身份。如果网站实施正确，则将通过SSL发送该网站，并将cookie标记为安全。但是，许多网站忽略了此步骤，而是通过非SSL连接发送该步骤（如果您曾经通过不安全的通信介质（例如，不安全的Wifi链接）使用计算机，则此步骤是不安全的），或者忘记将安全标志添加到cookie（如果您使用的是不安全的Wifi链接，那么对于主动的中间人攻击来说，这是不安全的）。

该cookie可以选择具有到期日期，或者可以在服务器端到期。这取决于Web服务器。也许没有必要让它过期，但是如果让您感到更舒服，则可以将其过期。

此功能增加了很多便利，因为它使您不必执行某些身份验证步骤。安全性/便利性折衷和安全性好处的确切细节将完全取决于特定网站如何使用“记住我”功能，并且不能以抽象的方式进行一般回答。

例如，许多网站可能会使用“记住我”功能，以便每次您从同一台计算机访问时都会自动登录，而无需输入密码。那很方便 这也意味着您可以合理地选择一个更长的密码：由于您几乎不必输入密码，因此您可以随意输入它，而不必担心记住或输入密码带来的不便。因此，从某种意义上讲，这确实提供了一些安全益处。





# [How safe is “trust this computer” option for websites?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/26743/how-safe-is-trust-this-computer-option-for-websites)



Many sites have a "trust this computer" option that allows one to bypass some security measures (ex.: with Google's 2-step authentication enabled, one [does not](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2544838) need to enter the phone's code if the computer/browser was previously marked as trusted). I'm having trouble to find more information about the subject, in particular on how to implement it securely, if possible at all.

(*Note:* I refer specifically to general-purpose sites, that rely on nothing special beyond the browsers' capabilities. My bank site for instance uses its own security module (using either Java or ActiveX), but that's beyond the scope of this question.)

## Assumptions:

- The computer to be marked as trusted is indeed only used by trusted people, and reasonable measures are taken to keep it malware-free.
- SSL is used to communicate to the site.

## Questions:

1. From what I could make of it, a cookie is used to store some arbitrary shared secret between the browser and the site. Is that all? Or does it employ some unique (an un-forgeable) way of uniquely identifying that particular computer or device?

   - In case it's really arbitrary, what properties does it need to be resistant to collisions and/or forgery? (length, randomness, ...)

2. Should the state of "trusted" expire at some point? Or is it enough to offer means to revoke it on demand, in case the user believes the computer/device was compromised?

3. Does it actually add any increased security? Using Google example again, I noticed it periodically requests me to authenticate again (using only username/password though). What's the reasoning behind this?

   - If it assumes the computer is still trusted, couldn't it just keep me authenticated forever?
   - If OTOH it assumes a malicious user might be using it, shouldn't it request a full authentication instead? (i.e. why it assumes just the password is enough? does it consider the computer itself to be the second factor?)

   I understand that, generally speaking, when the convenience goes up the security goes down. My doubt is whether or not this option defeats the purpose of two factor authentication, or it's indeed a reasonable compromise.

  I think your 3rd question can't be answered in the abstract; it's too broad, so the answer is "it depends". You have to look at the details of how a specific web site uses the feature, to do a security analysis. Different sites use "remember me"/"trust this computer" differently, and that will lead to different security tradeoffs. – [D.W.](https://security.stackexchange.com/users/971/d-w) [Jan 9 '13 at 6:57](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/26743/how-safe-is-trust-this-computer-option-for-websites#comment43497_26743)

- @D.W. you're right, this part is better left unanswered indeed. I gave one example, but now that you mentioned the "remember me" feature, I recall having seen other scenarios where the convenience feature (be it auto-login or single-factor login) could be voided depending on **how important** the user intended action was. So I agree it really depends on the circumstances. – [mgibsonbr](https://security.stackexchange.com/users/6939/mgibsonbr) [Jan 9 '13 at 7:42](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/26743/how-safe-is-trust-this-computer-option-for-websites#comment43502_26743)

Yes, the "remember me"/"trust this computer" option is safe to use, as long as you trust everyone else who might have access to your computer, and as long as it is implemented correctly.

It is generally implemented using a persistent cookie. The cookie contains a random, unguessable token that identifies you securely. If the website is implemented properly, it is sent over SSL and the cookie is marked secure. However, many websites omit this step and send it over non-SSL connections (which is insecure if you ever use your computer over an insecure communication medium, e.g., over an insecure Wifi link) or forget to add the secure flag to the cookie (which is not secure against an active man-in-the-middle attack if you are using an insecure Wifi link).

This cookie can optionally have an expiration date, or can be expired server-side. That's up to the web server. Probably there is no great need to expire it, but you could expire it if it makes you feel more comfortable.

This feature adds a great deal of convenience, as it spares you from having to go through certain authentication steps. The exact details of the security/convenience tradeoff and the security benefits will depend upon exactly how a particular web site uses the "remember me" feature, and cannot be answered generically in the abstract.

For instance, many websites may use the "remember me" feature so that you will be automatically logged in every time you visit from this same computer, without needing to type in your password. That's convenient. It also means you can reasonably choose a longer password: since you rarely have to enter in the password, you can make it as long as you want without worrying about the inconvenience of trying to memorize or type in the password. So, in some sense, this does provide some security benefits.
