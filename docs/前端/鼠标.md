[dragover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/dragover_event)
The dragover event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged over a valid drop target (every few hundred milliseconds).

[tabindex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) 响应键盘事件
Avoid using the tabindex attribute in conjunction with non-interactive content to make something intended to be interactive focusable by keyboard input. 

[focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus)
The :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key.
