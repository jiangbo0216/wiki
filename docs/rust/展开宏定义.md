# [How do I see the expanded macro code that's causing my compile error?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28580386/how-do-i-see-the-expanded-macro-code-thats-causing-my-compile-error)

`cargo rustc -- -Zunstable-options --pretty=expanded`, but a more concise alternative is the [cargo-expand](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand) crate. It provides a Cargo subcommand `cargo expand` which prints the result of macro expansion. It also passes the expanded code through [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) which generally results in much more readable code than the default output from rustc.

Install by running `cargo install cargo-expand`.
