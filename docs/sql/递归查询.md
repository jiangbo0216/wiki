# 递归查询

## 公用表表达式

   对于SELECT查询语句来说,通常情况下，为了使T-SQL代码更加简洁和可读，在一个查询中引用另外的结果集都是通过视图而不是子查询来进行分解的.但是，视图是作为系统对象存在数据库中，那对于结果集仅仅需要在存储过程或是用户自定义函数中使用一次的时候，使用视图就显得有些奢侈了.

  公用表表达式（Common Table Expression)是SQL SERVER 2005版本之后引入的一个特性.CTE可以看作是一个临时的结果集，可以在接下来的一个SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,MERGE语句中被多次引用。使用公用表达式可以让语句更加清晰简练.

   除此之外，根据微软对CTE好处的描述，可以归结为四点:

- 可以定义递归公用表表达式(CTE)
- 当不需要将结果集作为视图被多个地方引用时，CTE可以使其更加简洁
- GROUP BY语句可以直接作用于子查询所得的标量列
- 可以在一个语句中多次引用公用表表达式(CTE)

### **公用表表达式(CTE)的定义**

  公用表达式的定义非常简单，只包含三部分：

1. 公用表表达式的名字（在WITH之后）
2. 所涉及的列名（可选）
3. 一个SELECT语句(紧跟AS之后)

  在MSDN中的原型：

```sql
WITH expression_name [ ( column_name [,...n] ) ]

AS

( CTE_query_definition )
```

  按照是否递归，可以将公用表（CTE）表达式分为递归公用表表达式和非递归公用表表达式.

### **非递归公用表表达式(CTE)**

  非递归公用表表达式（CTE）是查询结果仅仅一次性返回一个结果集用于外部查询调用。并不在其定义的语句中调用其自身的CTE

  非递归公用表表达式（CTE）的使用方式和[视图](http://www.cnblogs.com/CareySon/archive/2011/12/07/2279522.html)以及[子查询](http://www.cnblogs.com/CareySon/archive/2011/07/18/2109406.html)一致

  比如一个简单的非递归公用表表达式:

  当然，公用表表达式的好处之一是可以在接下来一条语句中多次引用:

  由于CTE只能在接下来一条语句中使用，因此，当需要接下来的一条语句中引用多个CTE时，可以定义多个，中间用逗号分隔：

## [Recursive CTEs](https://www.essentialsql.com/recursive-ctes-explained/#:~:text=A%20recursive%20CTE%20is%20a%20CTE%20that%20references%20itself.,the%20complete%20result%20is%20returned.&text=A%20recursive%20CTE%20must%20contain,that%20references%20the%20CTE%20itself.)

A recursive CTE is a CTE that references itself.  In doing so, the initial CTE is repeatedly executed, returning subsets of data, until the complete result is returned.

Being able to reference itself is a unique feature and benefit. It allows recursive CTE’s to solve queries problems that would otherwise require the use of temporary tables, cursors, and other means.

Recursive CTE’s are well suited to querying hierarchical data, such as organization charts or production bill of materials, where each product’s components are made up of subcomponents, and so on.

The general syntax for a recursive CTE is:

```
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, …)
AS
(
   cte_query_definition -- Anchor member
   UNION ALL
   cte_query_definition -- Recursive member; references cte_name.
)
-- Statement using the CTE
SELECT *
FROM   cte_name
```

The general layout is similar to a non-recursive CTE. It is defined using WITH, consists of a query definition, and precedes the statement using the CTE.

Yet, there are significant differences. A recursive CTE must contain a UNION ALL statement and, to be recursive, have a second query definition that references the CTE itself.

Let’s look at a simple example.

Below is a recursive CTE that counts from 1 to 50.

```
WITH   cte
AS     (SELECT 1 AS n -- anchor member
        UNION ALL
        SELECT n + 1 -- recursive member
        FROM   cte
        WHERE  n < 50 -- terminator
       )
SELECT n
FROM   cte;
```

Here are the results:

There are many parts involved in this query, let’s look at them:

![Parts of A Recursive Common Table Expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiangbo0216/wiki/pic-bed/Parts-of-A-Recursive-Common-Table-Expression-1024x357.png)

This recursive CTE consists of three main parts:

1. Invocation – This is the statement using the CTE.
2. Anchor Member – This portion executes first and is only called once.
3. Recursive Member – The portion of the query is repeatedly executed until no rows are returned. The results of each execution are unioned with the prior results.
4. Termination Check – The termination check ensures the query stops.

When this query is run the Anchor Member is run once and its derived rows combined, via the UNION ALL, with the Recursive Member.

This query is repeatedly run until no rows are returned. This is why the termination check is so important.

If we weren’t checking for N < 50, the query would always return a row, thus complete with an error. Here is an example of the error you can expect if the termination check is missing or faulty:

```
Msg 530, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
The statement terminated. The maximum recursion 100 has been exhausted before statement completion.
```

Of course, there may be an instance where the maximum recursion should be greater than 100. In this case you can adjust it using the MAXRECURSION query hint. Here we’ve increased the recursion to 200.

```
WITH   cte
AS     (SELECT 1 AS n -- anchor member
        UNION ALL
        SELECT n + 1 -- recursive member
        FROM   cte
        WHERE  n < 50 -- terminator
       )
SELECT n
FROM   cte
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 200);
```

When writing a Recursive CTE keep in mind the following guidelines:

- A recursive CTE must contain at least an anchor member and recursive member. Multiple anchor and recursive members can be defined, but all the anchor members should be before the first recursive member.
- The number of columns and their corresponding data types should be the same between the anchor and recursive members. This makes sense, as this is a condition for UNION ALL.
- The FROM clause of the recursive member can only refer to the CTE expression once.

In addition, the following items are not allowed in the recursive member query definition:

- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- LEFT, RIGHT, or OUTER JOIN
- Scalar aggregation
- SELECT DISTINCT
- Subqueries
- TOP
