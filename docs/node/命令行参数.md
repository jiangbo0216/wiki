This changes how you will retrieve this value in the Node code.
The way you retrieve it is using the process object built into Node.
It exposes an argv property, which is an array that contains all the command line invocation
arguments.
The first argument is the full path of the node command.
The second element is the full path of the file being executed.
All the additional arguments are present from the third position going forward.
You can iterate over all the arguments (including the node path and the file path) using a loop:

```js
process.argv.forEach((val, index) => {
console.log(`${index}: ${val}`)
})

```

You can get only the additional arguments by creating a new array that excludes the first 2
params:

```js
const args = process.argv.slice(2)

```

> node app.js name=flavio

```js
const args = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2))
args['name'] //flavio
```
